### 宣布软件发布

**介绍**

任何开源项目的功能之一就是发布软件，目标是吸引尽可能多的用户。为了帮助项目取得成功，你需要确保及时用正确的信息向最广泛的相关受众分发你的发布新闻。

遵循一些协调发布公告的基本准则可以确保您的出色工作不会在混乱中迷失。请记住，这些只是指南；你的社区的做法可能会有所不同。

**通用准则**

- 不要把星期五或重要假期设置成发布日期。拥有最大覆盖率的理想发布日期是星期二。
- 如果可能的话，协调主发布版本与相关会议和活动。
- 定制发布公告和博客，以鼓励 _使用_ 软件以及 _贡献_ 软件。
- 阐述一个项目将如何使用户受益；解释好处而不是专注于技术细节。

**跟踪主要版本 X.0 的候选版本和最终版本**

遵循或调整以下过程以用于主要版本 (X.0)：

1. No less than three weeks from release date:
    a.Create a collaborative document (Etherpad, Google Doc) to include highlighted features for
       the release announcement, press release, and blog post.
2. Two weeks from release date:
    a.Generate a changelog outlining notable changes to the release that will need to be
       documented and included within the main changelog file.
    b. Merge any relevant content from the updated changelog into the release announcement,
    press release, and blog post.


```
c. Create press release and send to your organization’s media relations team for vetting.
c. 创建新闻稿并发送给您组织的媒体关系团队进行审查。
```
3. One week from release date:
    a.Schedule social media content for distribution before, during, and after release date.
4. Three days from release date:
    a.Confirm release manager and engineering lead have signed off on release announcement
       and blog post.
    b. Confirm media relations staff have signed off on press release.
5. Two days from release date:
    a.Complete all final QA/smoke tests.
    b. Place build on appropriate servers.
    c. Stage all documentation and review it for display issues.
6. One day before release date:
    a.Send copies of press release to relevant media outlets.
7. Day of release:
    a.Make all code and documentation visible to the world.
    b. Begin publishing scheduled social media and blog post materials.
    c. Post press release on newswires (in conjunction with media relations team).

**Track: Release candidate and final release for point release X.Y**

Follow or adapt this process for a Y point release (X.Y):

1. No less than 2 weeks from release date:
    a.Create a collaborative document (Etherpad, Google Doc) to include highlighted features for
       the release announcement and blog post.
2. One week from release date:
    a.Schedule social media content for distribution before, during, and after release date.
    b. Generate a changelog outlining notable changes to the release that will need to be
    documented and included within the main changelog file.
    c. Merge any relevant content from the updated changelog into the release announcement and
       blog post.
3. Two days from release date:
    a.Ensure the release manager and engineering lead have signed off on release announcement
       and blog post.
    b. Complete all final QA/smoke tests.
    c. Place build on appropriate servers.
    d. Stage all documentation and review it for display issues.
4. Day of release:


```
a.Make all code and documentation visible to the world.
b. Begin publishing scheduled social media and blog materials.
c. Send copies of press release to relevant media outlets.
```
**Track: Final release for minor point release X.Y.Z**

Follow or adapt this process for a minor Z point release (X.Y.Z):

1. No less than one week from release date:
    a.Schedule social media content for distribution before, during, and after release date.
    b. Generate a changelog outlining notable changes to the release that will need to be
    documented and included within the main changelog file.
    c. Merge any relevant content from the updated changelog into the release announcement and
       blog post.
2. Two days from release date:
    a.Ensure the release manager and engineering lead have signed off on release announcement
       and blog post.
    b. Complete all final QA/smoke tests.
    c. Place build on appropriate servers.
    d. Stage all documentation and review it for display issues.
3. Day of release:
    a.Make all release artifacts and documentation visible to the world, if not already (release
       may be synced to mirrors ahead of actual release announcement).
    b. Begin publishing scheduled social media and blog materials.

**After all major releases and significant point releases**

1. Conduct a retrospective to see what, if anything, could be done to improve the next release
    cycle.

**Writing a press release/release announcement**

Writing and distributing a release announcement would seem relatively straightforward; however,
some strategies for doing this work are more effective than others. Specifically, you should write
your release announcement in a way that makes it most likely for a media outlet to pick it up.
编写和发表一个软件发布的公告似乎相对简单；然而，使用良好的撰写策略能比。具体来说，你应该以一种最有可能被更多人接收的方式来撰写你的发布公告。

以下是发布公告的模板，以及一些指导方针。请注意，这只是一个指南；完全照搬这里的内容可能对你的项目没什么用。

对你在公开声明中分享的信息保持直接和真实。避免夸张的用词，例如“有史以来最好的项目！！！”，和猜测姓用词，例如“唯一可以做到这一点的项目”。其他人很快就会忽视这种夸张的说法，并且可能会完全避免传播有关你发布的消息。

发表公告不是一个大肆宣传你项目的机会，即使这个趁机宣传的机会会很诱人。你应该借此机会感谢您辛勤工作的社区，以此赞誉那些完成工作的人，并强调了项目的免费和开源性质。

发表公告做到简洁明了。用事实支持你的主张。这将有助于更广泛地传播您的公告。
